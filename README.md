# Statistical Analysis Project

Statistical analysis is the process of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It helps in discovering patterns, trends, and relationships within data sets, aiding in decision-making processes. This project provides a framework for performing statistical analysis using a sample dataset.

## Introduction

This project outlines the basic steps of statistical analysis, providing a systematic approach to collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting data. It includes methods for descriptive and inferential statistics, helping users make data-driven decisions.

## Data Collection

Data can be collected from various sources such as surveys, experiments, databases, etc. For this example, we will use a sample dataset available in pandas.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies to ensure the data is accurate.

## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics provide a summary of the data using measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and visualizations like histograms and box plots.

## Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics involve making predictions or generalizations about a population based on a sample. Common techniques include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.

### Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. A common test is the t-test.

### Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals provide a range of values that likely contain the population parameter.

### Regression Analysis

Regression analysis is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
